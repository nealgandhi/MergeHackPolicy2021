Merge Hack-Policy Github Repo for "NFTrees"
Team consiting of Charles Averill, Margaret Belford, 
Neal Gandhi, and Jeniel Zimmerman

Built using django over a 36 hour period by Charles Averill and Neal Gandhi

Used as an auction based website as an alternative for NFT usage due to the 
environmental impacts that they have

Deployed through pythonanywhere at

## Inspiration
NFTs have been around in the art community for quite some time, and the environmental impacts have not gone unnoticed. While they allow for artists to monetize their work in new and innovative ways, the resources it takes to sustain NFTs outweigh the usefulness that they bring.

As the world proceeds into more dire times with the environment, we thought that bringing an alternative way to allow artists to monetize their own items would reduce the usage of NFTs, thus reduce the strain on the environment.

## Policy Brief
Written in a 36 hour period by Jeniel Zimmerman and Margaret Belford
https://bit.ly/3cz5MFz

---

## What it does
NFTree offers a safe space for artists to auction off their creations by providing minting and auctioning services on a simple centralized platform. Unlike typical NFT minting, NFTree mints content using standardized UUID generation techniques, resulting in roughly a 30 billion time increase in energy efficiency. 

---

## How we built it
NFTree is built using Django, a Python-based free and open-source web framework. SQLite allows the user to login and auction off original artwork that can be traced back to them by storing individual auction characteristics in a database.

---

## Challenges we ran into
Hosting anything is a challenge, and this time around was no different. Hosting was easily the most time-consuming challenge of this project.

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The creation of a fully-functional user database with custom fields, and a functioning auction board.

---

## What we learned
We were able to learn a lot about the environmental impacts of NFTs and existing efforts to combat those impacts. Also, host your project at the *beginning*, not the end.

---

## What's next for NFTree
We plan to expand the platform to become a feature-rich junction for large amounts of NFT trade.
